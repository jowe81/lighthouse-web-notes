# Database Design - Khurram Virani
* Software is about modeling state (data) and behavior (actions on that data). For this reason most software needs some form of a database
* As a junior dev with little experience you shouldn't be responsible for too many architectural things that have long-term impact
* It's good to do couple years full-stack before specializing
* T-shaped Full Stack Developer: Can do all things (full stack) but have a specialization/focused interest
* Startups are more likely to ask for full-stack skills

## ERD
* Entity-Relationship Diagram
* Tool: app.diagrams.net, dbdiagram.io

## Table
* Columns: structure
* Rows: data
* lowercase underscore pluralized names for tables
* Relationships:
  * one-to-many
  * one-to-one
    * not common and not strictly necessary (can combine into single table), but separation of concerns still useful
  * many-to-many
    * needs bridge table

## Keys
* Foreign key: field in child table that points to the parent table

## Breakout
* Model out quiz functionality in Compass
  * quizzes    
  * questions
  * students
  * attempts

## AMA
* find mentorship beyond the job
* consider job description as wish lists and apply anyway
* build relationships with mentors
* LinkedIn

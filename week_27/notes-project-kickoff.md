Rules for success
- Get comfortable being uncomfortable

- Focus on minimum viable demo: 5 min presentation
- Avoid: "wouldn't it be cool if"

# Process
1. Idea
2. Write User Stories
3. Nouns give resources
4. Resources needs tables
5. ERD
6. Routes
7. Wireframes

- Make planning directory on repo; put all planning in there
- Leave only polish, cleanup, presentation prep for the last week
- Learning new frameworks and languages means less features though it can be impressive
- Prioritize risk mitigation upfront
  - Test APIs up front
- Communicate regularly
- Estimate how long things take, though it's difficult
  - Break it down
- Write down your technical and non-technical weaknesses
- You should be able to speak to all code in the codebases
- Fork repo on Github if it's not in your account
- Do not start slowly to avoid panic mode at the end
- Discuss git management
  - Never code on master
- How does database stay up to date?
- Discuss git plan with a mentor

Plan:
- Week 27 Plan and revise
- Week 28 Code
- Week 29 Code
- Week 30 Polish, Cleanup, Demo prep


IDEAL project:
- Well Designed (looks polished)
- "Steal" good design from other sites
- Use modern frameworks
- Use modern CSS flexbox, grid, sass...
- Little to no automated testing
  - Do some cypress tests if time in final week
  - Add some testing after the bootcamp

Good demo:
- Look good
- Act like youre having fun even if you don't. Have a positive attitude
- No major bugs (avoid/hide)
- Flows well, rehearse. Very important.
  - Script it, who says what
- Teams show of skills not just project
  - What did I/we learn?

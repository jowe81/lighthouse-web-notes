Cover letter

Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Johannes Weber and I'm a recent LighthouseLabs grad seeking to transition to web development. I have coded for many years and repeatedly written Node/Express apps to solve problems in my role as Technical Director or streamline tasks.
I am hoping to further build my expertise in the context of a web development role and would be grateful if you considered my application.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you for your time,
Johannes

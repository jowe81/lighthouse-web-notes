# Week 8 Front End

## Chrome Dev Tools
* Apple + Alt + J
* Sources Panel: file navigator, code editor, and JS Debugging page
  * Event Listener Breakpoints (eg. onClick)
  * DOM modification breakpoints
  * Manual breakpoints: ```debugger``` keyword
  * Watch expressions during debugging
  * Step through code line by line, to or through the next function call
  * Edit code directly in the code editor. Apple+S will save modifications (until reload)
* Rendering/animations tab - paint flash: indicate areas that are repainting (bad for performance)
* CSS Prototyping with DevTools
  * Add/remove classes
  * Copy styles from anywhere!
  * Get Screenshots of elements or areas of the page
